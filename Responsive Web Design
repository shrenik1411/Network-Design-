# Responsive Web Design
Design and develop a website to provide information to customers who wants to visit the shop. The goal is to allow customers to obtain an overview of the shop layout and to find details of items available from the shop. The website is not an online shopping site. The websiteâ€™s main goal is to provide information to customers who want to visit the shop in person.
