            <p class="aboutus" align="justify"><em> Toys are an inseparable part of everyone's childhood. Since birth, most children are in contact with these diverse objects. Besides entertainment purposes, toys also play an important role in the development of children. Toys are educational tools that help children to perceive a scale model of social interactions in the world. For example, construction sets teach children about the mechanics of buildings and medical playing sets teach children about treatment of disease. Also, toys foster traditional gender roles among children. Toys are often categorized by gender - "girl's toys" and "boy's toys." This phenomenon has perpetuated outdated gender stereotypes as "girl's toys" are focused on the theme of "beauty and home-making" while "boy's toys" are focused on the theme of "battle and aggression".  </em>
