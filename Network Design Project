# Network-Design
Project Definition:
The objective of this project was to design a network solution from a given scenario for the farmerâ€™s cooperative society called Smart Farmers (SF) who are having a crop farmers associated with them so they can help them to trade directly to the customers without any third-party involvement and which was located at the Queensland state and having a six distribution centres in the different cities. There was also a small office in the Rockhampton from where the office staff do the operational work, and the member farmers were provided with the online banking facilities as well. Also, the SF were having their own proprietary software and all the things will be managed through this only for example: farmers can use this for their crops knowledge they control their crops using the sensors associated with IoT mechanisms and other operational stuffs. This was a group project, and we were four people. We need to do the following task:

1) List of Business Goals and Constraints
2) List of Technical Goals and Trade-offs
3) Table of User Communities, Data Stores, Network Applications and Traffic Flows 4) Model for addressing and naming
5) Explanation and justification of the logical network design
6) Logical network diagram(s) including addressing and naming
7) Discussion of routing and switching protocols
8) Discussion of security mechanisms
   
Tools: Draw.io was used for the network at other diagrams, CISCO packet tracer was used for the correct simulation, and online subnet calculator was used for IP and subnetting

Duties: We had divided the task in to two task each and my part was to form a Table of User Communities, Data Stores, Network Applications and Traffic Flows, Model for addressing and naming. It was a group project, and we were four members.

Outcome: At the end we managed to complete the given project well and our tutor gives us a good comment on the work done by our team upon the submission. Also, there was a report need to be made by us on this project from this simulation and scenario-based project.
